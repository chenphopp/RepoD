# RepoD
Question

## 1. How did you test your pipelines?
I tested the pipelines directly on my Jenkins instance:
- For **PipelineB**: I confirmed that it cloned RepoA, generated the Doxygen config, produced HTML docs, and archived `doc.tar.gz`.

- For **PipelineC**: I verified that Doxygen produced `warnings.log`, then RepoCâ€™s parser script successfully generated `warnings.csv`. Both were archived in Jenkins as artifacts.

## 2. How did you test RepoC Python?
- I first ran the parser locally with a sample `warnings.log` file produced by Doxygen.
- Verified that non-standard lines were ignored.
- Confirmed that the output CSV contained the expected columns: Line, File, Message.

## 3. What is the advantage to use LFS?
- Efficiently manages large binary files (e.g., .tar.gz, .zip, .exe).
- Stores only a pointer in the Git repo, so the repo size stays small.
- Faster clone/pull operations.
- Developers download only the needed file versions.

## 4. How to adjust this repository to support LFS?
- Install Git LFS (git lfs install) : https://git-lfs.com/
- Tracking the large binary
```
git lfs track "*.tar.gz"
git lfs track "*.zip"
git lfs track "*.exe"
```
```
git add .gitattributes
```
```
git commit -m "Enable Git LFS for large binaries"
git push origin main
```

Alternatives:
- Use Jenkins artifacts, Nexus, JFrog or Artifactory for binary storage instead of Git.
