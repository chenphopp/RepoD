Question

## 1. How did you test your pipelines?
I tested the pipelines directly on my Jenkins instance:
- For **PipelineB**: I confirmed that it cloned RepoA, generated the Doxygen config, produced HTML docs, and archived `doc.tar.gz`.

- For **PipelineC**: I verified that Doxygen produced `warnings.log`, then RepoCâ€™s parser script successfully generated `warnings.csv`. Both were archived in Jenkins as artifacts.

## 2. How did you test RepoC Python?
- I first ran the parser locally with a sample `warnings.log` file produced by Doxygen.
- Verified that non-standard lines were ignored.
- Confirmed that the output CSV contained the expected columns: Line, File, Message.
